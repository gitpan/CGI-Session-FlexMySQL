CGI::Session::FlexMySQL is a derivation from CGI::Session::MySQL which allows module users  to fully customize the MySQL connection including data tables and field names, as well as more precisely control when the database handle is disconnected.

Example:

           $session = new CGI::Session("driver:FlexMySQL", $sid, {
              Handle => $dbh,
              Table => 'custom_table',    # You can put your sessions in any table
              KeyField => 'SessionID',    # Use any field for your session ids
              DataField => 'SessionData', # Use any field for your session data 
              AutoDisconnect => 0,        # So your $dbh stays open even after $session is gone
           });
